## Cognitive States and Ethical Relevance

### I. Purpose
This framework clarifies which modes of human consciousness carry ethical or moral weight, and why others do not. It is descriptive, not prescriptive—an attempt to map awareness according to who else participates and what can be affected.

---

### II. Core Principles

1. **Ethics Requires Participation**  
   Ethics arises only when there are at least two conscious participants who can recognize and affect each other.

2. **Private Phenomena Are Ethically Neutral**  
   Experiences contained entirely within one mind—dreams, thoughts, fantasies, hallucinations—have no moral status. They may inform later behavior but are not themselves subject to ethical judgment.

3. **Agency Depends on Awareness and Control**  
   Moral responsibility requires the ability to distinguish real from imagined and to act intentionally. When awareness or control is compromised (asleep, dreaming, psychotic), moral evaluation ceases to apply.

4. **Expression Is the Ethical Threshold**  
   Ethics begins only when something internal becomes external—when thought becomes word, behavior, or consequence in shared reality.

### III. Taxonomy of Mental States

| **State** | **Characteristics** | **Participants** | **Causal Reach** | **Ethical Status** | **Notes** |
|------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------|
| **Normal waking awareness** | Stable identity, voluntary action, shared reality. | Multiple (social). | Direct—behavior affects others. | **Fully ethical domain** | Foundation of all moral judgment. |
| **Daydreaming** | Semi-voluntary, internally generated imagery. | Single (self). | None (unless expressed). | **Ethically neutral** | Mental rehearsal or creative simulation. |
| **Dreaming (sleep)** | Involuntary, narrative, emotionally rich. | Single (self). | None. | **Ethically neutral** | Symbolic processing, memory integration. |
| **Lucid dreaming** | Self-awareness within dream. | Single (self). | None. | **Ethically neutral** | Epistemically interesting, not moral. |
| **Hallucination** | Perceptual distortion, partial loss of reality testing. | Apparent others, not real. | None (internally contained). | **Ethically neutral / clinically relevant** | Concern is wellbeing, not morality. |
| **Psychotic break** | Loss of coherence, delusional participation. | Apparent others (internally generated). | None (non-shared). | **Ethically exempt** | Treated medically, not morally. |
| **Memory / imagination** | Reconstruction of past/future scenes. | Single (self). | None until communicated. | **Ethically neutral but influential** | Affects future action but not judged itself. |

### IV. The Ethical Horizon

Human ethics operates within a single active layer of awareness:

```
[ Subconscious / Dream / Imagination ]  →  Private, non-ethical
[ Waking Expression / Action ]          →  Shared, ethical
```

Below the horizon (inner life) lies pre-ethical experience—it shapes the person but does not implicate them. Above the horizon (speech, behavior, deliberate omission) lies the ethical domain.

---

### V. Transitional Roles

Non-ethical states serve as **ethical substrates**:
- **Dreaming** digests emotional conflict, reducing harmful impulse.
- **Daydreaming** allows rehearsal of possible choices before acting.
- **Memory and imagination** prepare or repair the moral self.

They are support systems for ethics, not ethical acts themselves.

---

### VI. Why Humans Draw the Line Here

1. **Privacy of Mind** – There is no direct mental interactivity between people.
2. **Empirical Causality** – Only physical or communicative acts cause harm or benefit.
3. **Reciprocity** – Ethics presupposes mutual awareness; dreams and fantasies lack it.
4. **Pragmatism** – Societies must anchor responsibility in observable behavior.

Human ethics is thus **public by definition**.

### VII. Summary

| **Domain** | **Ethical Applicability** | **Reason** |
|-------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| Private mental content | None | No shared participation or causal reach. |
| Expression / communication | Full | Others can perceive and be affected. |
| Action / behavior | Full | Concrete consequences. |
| Involuntary or impaired states | Limited / None | Agency compromised. |

### VIII. Indigenous and Expanded Mental States

Many Indigenous cultures include additional or interwoven states of awareness that extend beyond the binary of waking and dreaming. These may include:

- **Visionary or trance states** reached through ceremony, song, or dance.
- **Communal dreaming** or **collective visioning**, where experience is shared symbolically within a group.
- **Ancestral or spirit communication** as valid mental participation with non-human agents.

From within those frameworks, such states *do* include participation and therefore may hold ethical dimensions—for example, a dream or vision that conveys obligations toward kin, land, or spirits. The distinction between private and public experience is less rigid because the self is not viewed as wholly separate.

For Western ethical analysis, these modes can be understood as **expanded participation states**: contexts where mental events are taken to have real relational significance. They remind us that what counts as “shared reality”—and therefore as an ethical field—depends on cultural ontology.

### IX. Conclusion

Ethics arises only where awareness, intention, and participation overlap.  
Private mental life is not an ethical domain, but it feeds and shapes the ethical self.  
Across cultures, this boundary between private and shared awareness is drawn differently—yet the human constant remains: ethics begins where minds meet.
