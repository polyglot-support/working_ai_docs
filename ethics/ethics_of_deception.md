**Title: Structural Ethics of Dishonesty and Deception**

**I. Introduction**
Dishonesty and deception have traditionally been evaluated through the lenses of moral philosophy: deontology (Kant), consequentialism (Mill), and virtue ethics (Aristotle). This framework proposes an alternative approach: dishonesty is ethically problematic not because of imposed moral imperatives, but because it violates the structural preconditions for agency, knowledge generation, consent, and subjective continuity.

**II. Core Axiom: Honesty as a Structural Necessity**
> An action is dishonest if it violates the computational or epistemic conditions necessary for maintaining valid agency relations, subjective temporal flow, and coherent knowledge structures.

This axiom reframes dishonesty not as a social taboo but as a type of structural breach, akin to introducing logical inconsistencies into a formal system or corrupting a causal inference graph.

**III. Structural Layers of Ethical Integrity**
The theory recognizes several interdependent layers which dishonesty can violate:

1. **Knowability Constraints**
   - Claiming or concealing knowledge outside bounded epistemic possibility (e.g. knowing someone else's unknowable future state).
   - Suppressing discoverable information (novel discoveries, subjective truths).

2. **Logical Coherence**
   - Forcing binary truth where paraconsistent or partial values are structurally necessary.
   - Exploiting or creating paradoxes by misrepresenting logical context.

3. **Consent Integrity**
   - Acting when consent tension (d_con) > 0.
   - Misrepresenting consent states or inference procedures used to derive them.

4. **Epistemic Horizon Respect**
   - Extracting or misrepresenting interior (H^int) or exterior (H^ext) knowledge boundaries.
   - Pretending to have total self-knowledge or denying others' mental privacy.

5. **Epistemic Path Validity**
   - Offering conclusions without valid paths (e.g. high entropy, failed constraint satisfaction).
   - Falsifying coherence or anchoring.

6. **Incompleteness Compliance**
   - Claiming finality or closure in domains that must remain open.
   - Collapsing the temporal or inferential space that ensures agent adaptability.

7. **Adversarial Ethics**
   - Deliberately manipulating the structural layers above.
   - Creating information environments where others' honest operation becomes structurally impossible.

**IV. Redefining Dishonesty**
Dishonesty is redefined as any of the following:
- Assertion of structurally impossible knowledge.
- Corruption of inference graphs or knowledge paths.
- Manipulation of agent preferences through invalid models.
- Concealment or falsification of subjective states that influence shared reality.
- Compression of open future states into deterministic claims.

**V. Ethical Operationalization**
Rather than proscribing deception via moral edict, the framework supports actionable governance:
- **Consent Metrics:** Use of d_con to determine valid interaction.
- **Causal Graph Validation:** Only infer from structurally valid evidence paths.
- **Knowability Filtering:** Exclude unknowables and bound inference by sigma_A.
- **Risk Calibration:** Employ consent-weighted loss functions for uncertain actions.
- **Revisability:** All claims and models must permit correction over time.

**VI. Applications and Implications**
- **AI Design:** Ethical agents must not violate knowability, must respect consent structures, and should maintain audit trails for inference decisions.
- **Human Governance:** Legal systems can model dishonesty as structural consent breach, not just intention to mislead.
- **Interpersonal Ethics:** Honesty requires preserving others' epistemic autonomy, not just telling truths.

**VII. Conclusion**
This theory grounds the ethics of dishonesty in the structural integrity of cognitive, epistemic, and relational systems. It abandons moral absolutism in favor of a constraint-based ethics where deception is unethical not because it's forbidden, but because it corrupts the very substrate of agency and mutual understanding.
