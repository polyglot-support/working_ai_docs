**Title:** Consent Fields and Identity Collapse: Toward a Scalar Theory of Agency and Coherence

**Abstract:**
We propose a foundational framework in which the concept of "consent" is elevated from ethical or social construct to a universal ontological operator governing the emergence, persistence, and stability of identity across physical, cognitive, informational, and relational systems. By modeling consent as a scalar-valued coherence field, we show that identity collapse in any system results from a failure or absence of selective consent to interaction. This scalar theory of consent generalizes coherence dynamics across disciplines, from quantum measurement and signal theory to trauma psychology and organizational behavior. Consent, redefined as the gating condition of action and interpretation, is shown to be prerequisite to the emergence of meaning, matter, and agency.

**1. Introduction: Consent Beyond Ethics**
Consent is traditionally viewed through a moral or legal lens. We propose a broader ontological interpretation: consent as the structural filter that permits interaction to retain semantic integrity. Without consent, action dissolves into noise, interaction into incoherence, and identity into collapse. This paper explores the hypothesis that consent is a fundamental coherence condition for all structured phenomena.

**2. Consent and Signaling: The Coherence Gate**
Signaling without shared protocol—without mutual readiness or consent—is indistinguishable from noise. At every level of system interaction:

- Communication requires encoding and decoding schemas (semantic consent).
- Neural firing requires synaptic thresholds (biological consent).
- Memory and computation require interface validation (computational consent).

Without consent as a selective filter, signaling fails to produce information, and interaction fails to produce structure.

**3. Identity as a Function of Consent Coherence**
We define identity as a system's ability to maintain coherent distinction over time.

**Necessary properties:**
- Boundary maintenance
- Causal persistence
- Internal state continuity

**Consent Failure → Identity Collapse:**
When a system is exposed to unconstrained or unfiltered interaction, coherence dissolves. Identity becomes enmeshed or overwritten. This mirrors quantum decoherence, psychological fragmentation, and systemic failure in overloaded networks.

**4. Consent as a Scalar Field**
We formalize a continuous-valued consent field:

\[ \mathcal{C}(x, t) \in [0, 1] \]

- \( \mathcal{C} = 1 \): full individuated consent
- \( \mathcal{C} = 0 \): total exposure, no boundary

Define "identity resilience" over a region \( V \) as:

\[ \text{Identity}_V = \int_V \mathcal{C}(x) \, dV \]

This provides a scalar measure of structural or agentic coherence in any system, applicable to physical, cognitive, social, and computational domains.

**5. Examples Across Domains**
**Quantum Physics:**
- Collapse of wavefunction depends on selective measurement (consensual entanglement).

**Thermodynamics:**
- Entropy increase = decrease in selective structure; consent field diffusion.

**Information Theory:**
- Channel capacity and semantic integrity depend on mutual agreement (consent) of protocol.

**Psychology:**
- Trauma = identity destabilization from nonconsensual interaction (violated boundary integrity).

**Sociopolitical Systems:**
- Totalitarian collapse or anarchy emerges when consent mechanisms (laws, social contracts) are violated or absent.

---

**6. Implications and Extensions**
- **Agency**: Redefinable as the capacity to preserve a non-zero consent field.
- **Healing/Recovery**: Rebuilding identity = increasing local consent coherence.
- **Ethics**: Not prescriptive but descriptive: consent is the ontological condition for meaningful interaction.
- **Artificial Systems**: AI and networks must model and respect consent boundaries to maintain coherent identity spaces.

---

**7. Conclusion**
Consent is not merely a social or moral tool—it is a universal structural necessity. Where consent degrades, identity collapses. The consent field framework provides a unifying metric across disciplines for coherence, agency, and the conditions that make reality intelligible.
