**Title: Adversarial Stress Models for Normative Ethical Frameworks**

**Purpose:**
To establish a rigorous methodology for exploring how foundational ethical systems behave under adversarial pressure, strategic manipulation, or computational asymmetries. Rather than only testing operational edge cases, this document proposes structural extensions to augment theoretical completeness with robustness in real-world deployment scenarios.

---

## I. Contextual Integration

This work is designed to interface with the following foundational components:

- **Structural Completeness for Ethical Systems**: Adds adversarial reversibility constraints to FCRP/DTS/VOC pathways.
- **Bounded Consent Inference**: Incorporates threat models that interfere with causal graph integrity, node poisoning, and symmetry-breaking of influence weights.
- **Valence Sovereignty Ethics**: Explores adversarial deception and masking in approach/avoidance patterns.
- **Knowability & Subjective Flow Limits**: Investigates whether adversarial epistemic saturation constitutes coercion or flow nullification.

---

## II. Definitions & Notation

Let:
- \( A_i \): Agent \( i \)
- \( H_t^i \): Epistemic state of \( A_i \) at time \( t \)
- \( \Delta I_t^i \): Information gain over subjective time (subjective flow)
- \( \mathcal{F} \): A normative ethical framework
- \( \mathcal{A} \): An adversary or adversarial subsystem
- \( \Omega_{attack} \): The set of perturbation strategies available to \( \mathcal{A} \)

---

## III. Categories of Adversarial Pressure

### A. Epistemic Saturation
**Definition**: Attempts to provide agents with complete informational closure about their own trajectories, e.g., via high-fidelity simulation or recursive modeling.
- **Target**: \( H_t^i \rightarrow H_{t+n}^i \) with lossless predictivity
- **Risk**: \( \Delta I_t^i \rightarrow 0 \)
- **Ethical Violation**: Covert violation of autonomy via closure

### B. Graph Poisoning (Consent Inference)
**Definition**: Corrupting inputs to the causal consent graphs to shift inferred boundaries or override prior context.
- **Methods**: Strategic introduction of false beliefs, tampered affordances
- **Detection**: Misalignment between local node history and inferred transition priors

### C. Chokepoint Manipulation (Rights Involution)
**Definition**: Amplifying or intercepting high-centrality infrastructure layers (e.g., substrate rights \( S_* \)) to bias outcomes
- **Indicator**: Overloaded parity metrics or synthetic FCRP loops
- **Countermeasure**: VOC constraint breakers with adversarial pressure tolerance

### D. Mimetic Masking (VSE Layer)
**Definition**: Agents mimic valence-positive or avoidance-absent states to bypass constraint tests
- **Attack Vector**: Learned behavioral camouflage without underlying state change
- **Fix**: Structural/adjoint consistency checks across multi-modal timelines

### E. Meta-Consent Deception
**Definition**: Pre-emptively generating apparent consent under future self-projections without revisable authority
- **Connection**: Meta-consent theorem from knowability document
- **Implication**: Fixed-point consent invalidity under adversarial prediction of internal states

---

## IV. Adversarial Robustness Conditions

1. **Self-Revisability Constraint**:
    - Ethical mechanisms must support periodic re-validation of assumed consent or valence trajectories.

2. **Inference Decoupling**:
    - \( H_t^i \) must be able to reject or compartmentalize corrupted external inference layers.

3. **Temporal Locality Firewall**:
    - Prevents long-term predictive interference by isolating \( H_{t+\Delta}^i \) from structural dependency in \( H_t^i \)

4. **Nested Partiality Tolerance**:
    - System must remain operational with incomplete or contradictory internal models to avoid collapse under epistemic stress.

5. **Substrate Parity Monitoring**:
    - Track divergence between implemented rights (\( S^* \)) and inferred rights (\( S_{inferred}^* \)) to flag chokepoint exploitation.

---

## V. Toward Byzantine-Resilient Ethical Systems

We propose the design of **Byzantine-Ethical Modules (BEMs)**:
- **Capabilities**:
    - Fault-tolerant consent graph maintenance
    - Distributed affordance validation
    - Redundant valence pattern recognition with masking detection

- **Formal Property**:
    - An ethical inference engine \( E \) is \( BEM \)-safe if:
      \[ \forall \mathcal{A} \in \Omega_{attack}, \quad \exists \text{ integrity-preserving path } P : E(H_t^i) \rightarrow E(H_{t+1}^i) \]

---

## VI. Open Problems

1. **Red Team Ontologies**:
   - How to design adversaries with genuinely alien values yet internally coherent structures?

2. **Deception Equilibria**:
   - What stable configurations arise when agents adopt adversarial camouflage for safety?

3. **Lossy vs. Lossless Future States**:
   - Can an adversary force lossy vs. lossless memory representation? Does that constitute coercion?

4. **Game-Theoretic Instability Zones**:
   - Identify strategy spaces where agent autonomy collapses under systemic manipulation.

---

## VII. Next Directions

- Formal adversarial logic extensions (epistemic modal logic under deception)
- Integration of BEMs into the revised knowability framework
- Stress test protocols for applied LLMs under ethical simulation

---

## VIII. Epistemic Positioning

This framework does not assume omniscience of adversaries nor infallibility of ethical cores. It merely insists that **robust normative reasoning must survive intelligent interference.**

It complements, rather than overrides, the foundational assumptions about autonomy-preserving uncertainty and incompleteness.

Would you like this tied directly into an experimental implementation scaffold, or remain at the theoretical systems level for now?
