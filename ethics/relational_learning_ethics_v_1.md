# Relational Learning Ethics (Draft)

## 1. Definitions
Relational learning is the process by which agents acquire and refine knowledge through interaction with others. Information is considered raw, newly generated state that has not yet been contextualized or validated. Knowledge is information that has been successfully integrated into an agent’s internal model in a manner that supports future decision‑making while preserving or increasing the collective capacity for growth (ΔFg). Individual freedom capacity (Fi) refers to an agent’s ability to learn and safely incorporate new information without harming others. Global freedom capacity (Fg) denotes the shared ability of all agents to learn, act, and explore without constraint. ΔFi and ΔFg express how these capacities change over time.

## 2. Core Principles
At its foundation, relational learning holds that knowledge does not emerge in isolation. Every meaningful increase in understanding is the result of interaction—between individuals, communities, species, or technical systems. The first principle asserts that learning is intrinsically relational: a solitary agent cannot reliably transform information into knowledge without reference to other agents who can validate, contextualize, or challenge its interpretations.

The second principle establishes that knowledge is not merely accumulated information, but rather information that has been integrated in a way that preserves or expands the collective’s ability to grow. If newly acquired understanding causes others to lose capacity—by obscuring access, increasing dependency, or fostering inequity—then the process has failed to produce knowledge in the ethical sense defined here.

The third principle states that ethical learning requires that one agent’s progress must not reduce another’s ability to progress. This does not imply identical outcomes, but rather a non-negative relationship: individual improvement must not come at a systemic cost. True knowledge is therefore cooperative by nature.

Finally, the overarching purpose of relational learning is to foster positive-sum development. When the collective’s capacity for exploration and action is maintained or increased, learning has succeeded. If the system stagnates—if the sum of all beneficial motion approaches zero—then a restructuring event becomes necessary, allowing new relational patterns to emerge.

## 3. Relation to Cooperative Growth Formalism. Relation to Cooperative Growth Formalism
- ΔS > 0 is only achieved via relational learning.
- Hierarchy emerges from differences in safe integration ability.
- Ethics constrain learning to non-negative effect on others.

## 4. Process Model
- **4.1 Generation:** Agents produce new information.
- **4.2 Integration:** Information becomes knowledge.
- **4.3 Validation:** Shared context verifies ΔFg ≥ 0.
- **4.4 Dissemination:** Distribution increases collective capacity.

## 5. Ethical Constraints
- **E1:** Learning must not decrease ΔFg.
- **E2:** Information must be handled to avoid harm.
- **E3:** Dissemination should improve autonomy.

## 6. Developmental Hierarchy
- Capacity to safely integrate and share determines access.
- Not status-based; strictly developmental.

## 7. Phase Stagnation
- If ΣΔS = 0 → learning space exhausted → transition.
- No memory of deadlock event.

## 8. Multi-Agent Implications
- Collaboration → improved ΔFg.
- Isolation → risks ΔFg < 0.

## 9. Consequences
- Relational learning is necessary, not optional.
- Knowledge emerges only when validated relationally.

## 10. Practical Examples
- **10.1 Mentor–Apprentice:** Safe transfer of high-risk knowledge increases ΔFg.
- **10.2 Lab Safety:** Protocols ensure ΔFi > 0 without ΔFg < 0.
- **10.3 Open Scientific Review:** Validation ensures knowledge increases collective capacity.

## 11. Failure Modes
- **11.1 Mislearning:** Incorrect integration → ΔFg < 0.
- **11.2 Coercive Teaching:** Reduces autonomy; violates non-negative constraint.
- **11.3 Epistemic Capture:** Hoarding blocks dissemination; suppresses ΔFg.

## 12. Safeguards
- **12.1 Peer Validation:** Prevents mislearning.
- **12.2 Transparency:** Enables collective verification.
- **12.3 Access Gating:** Based on safe integration capacity.

## 13. AI–Human Co-learning
- **13.1 Symmetric Constraints:** ΔFg applies to both.
- **13.2 Translation Layers:** Bridge representational gaps.
- **13.3 Shared Domains:** Collaborative discovery.

## 14. Expansion
- **14.1 Nested Learning Systems:** Subsystems contribute to ΔFg.
- **14.2 Recursive Evaluation:** Learning processes themselves evolve.
