# A Relational Formalism for Alive/Dead Across Temporal Complexity

## 1. Overview
This document formalizes the idea that the alive/dead distinction is not inherently unary. Instead, its arity depends on the underlying system's temporal and organizational complexity. The progression moves from unary (existence) to binary (environmental coupling) to higher-arity (multi-agent, temporally extended, intentional coupling).

---

## 2. Informal Motivation
At low complexity, organisms do not exhibit meaningfully differentiated behavior. Their life-status can be reduced to presence/absence of self-maintaining structure. At higher complexity, life depends on sustained nonequilibrium exchange with environment. At advanced complexity, life becomes multi-relational: life-processes reference time, other agents, and layered modeling.

## 3. Definitions

### 3.1 Unary Alive Predicate
Alive(A): A exists in a self-sustaining structural configuration.
- No reference to environment or temporal history required.
- Applicable to minimal autocatalytic or self-stable systems.

### 3.2 Binary Alive Predicate
Alive(A, E): A sustains nonequilibrium structure via energetic and informational coupling with environment E.
- Behavior implies ongoing process.
- Death implies irreversible loss of recoverable structure.

### 3.3 Ternary and Higher-Arity Alive Predicates
Alive(A, E, t): A and E are causally coupled at time t, sustaining low-entropy order.
Alive(A, E, B): A and B interact, mediated by E.
Alive(A, E, others..., t): Encodes ecological + social + temporal couplings.

## 4. Relation to Temporal Structure
"Life" demands temporality. The stronger the dependency on time-indexed causal process, the higher the predicate arity. If time halts, unary predicates may remain well-formed; binary+ predicates collapse or become undefined.

---

## 5. Density of Structure vs Predicate Arity
Low complexity → unary
Medium → binary (agent–environment)
High → n-ary (social, intentional, recursive modeling)

---

## 6. Alive/Dead Under Temporal Cessation
- Unary: state persists trivially.
- Binary+: process cannot continue → predicate undefined rather than false.

---

## 7. Summary Taxonomy
Unary → existence
Binary → coupling
Ternary+ → coupling + temporal + multi-agent

---

## 8. Consequences
Alive/dead is not intrinsic; it's relational. The distinction only stabilizes once time-indexed interaction is specified.
