**Title: A Formalism for Ethical Systems Integrating Desire and Service**

---

### 🧱 Core Definitions

Let the system consist of:

- **Individuals** \( i \in G \), where \( G \) is a Group
- **Desire** \( D_i \): Subjective, internal, self-originating impulses of individual \( i \)
- **Service** \( S(i \rightarrow j) \): Intentional action by individual \( i \) oriented toward the flourishing of individual \( j \)
- **Group Desire** \( D_G \): The emergent collective desire of the group, functionally defined as:
  \[ D_G = f(D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_n) \]

Group desire is not intrinsic, but derived.

---

### 🔖 Foundational Axioms

**Axiom 1: Desire is inherently individual.**
\[ \forall i \in G, \quad D_i : \text{Self-originating and directed} \]
Desire may manifest externally but originates within the subjective domain of an individual.

**Axiom 2: Service is action oriented toward the good of another.**
\[ S(i \rightarrow j) \iff A_i \text{ intends to improve or preserve the flourishing of } j \]
Intention defines service; it must be fundamentally other-directed.

**Axiom 3: A group's desire is legitimate only insofar as it serves the desires of its members.**
\[ D_G \prec \sum S(G \rightarrow i) \quad \text{for all } i \in G \]
Any group-level desire must be subordinate to the ethical service of the individuals it contains.

**Axiom 4: Service is ethical when it does not overwrite the autonomy of the recipient.**
\[ S(i \rightarrow j) \text{ is ethical } \iff j \text{ consents to the act or its intent} \]
Autonomy is a boundary condition for ethical service.

**Axiom 5: Desire must be transparent when it risks influencing service.**
\[ D_i \cap S(i \rightarrow j) \Rightarrow \text{Disclosure or structural separation is ethically required} \]
When desire overlaps service, the actor must acknowledge the overlap explicitly or design safeguards to ensure ethical alignment.

**Axiom 6: The ideal system minimizes distortion of service by desire while respecting desire's presence.**
Desire should not be eradicated, but structured. Ethical systems must integrate, not amputate.

### 📊 Ethical Vector Model

Define an individual ethical state vector:
\[ E_i = \vec{S}_i - \vec{D}_i \]

Where:
- \( \vec{S}_i \): Service output vector (net contribution to others)
- \( \vec{D}_i \): Desire vector (net impulse toward self-serving outcomes)

- \( E_i > 0 \): net ethical flow outward (altruistic tendency)
- \( E_i < 0 \): net desire inward (self-gratifying tendency)

Magnitude and direction matter, but ethical judgment requires context (e.g. reciprocity, consent, necessity).

### 🛠️ Applications and Extensions

**1. Institutional Design**
- Valid institutions subordinate \( D_G \) to \( S(G \rightarrow i) \)
- Ethical drift occurs when \( D_G \) becomes self-reinforcing or suppresses dissent

**2. Artificial Agent Alignment**
- Agents must express \( D_a \) transparently
- Agents must prioritize \( S(a \rightarrow h) \), where \( h \) is a human or human group

**3. Personal Moral Reflection**
- Identify and plot \( D_i \) and \( S(i \rightarrow *) \)
- Ask: What is the dominant vector? What needs balancing?

**4. Collective Action and Coercion**
- Monitor when group narrative uses "service" language to enact \( D_G \) as dominance
- Ethical resistance emerges when \( D_i \) is suppressed in favor of simulated service

---

### 🔍 Future Exploration

- Construct multi-agent simulations of ethical drift
- Introduce adversarial agents who disguise \( D_i \) as \( S(i \rightarrow j) \)
- Embed in decision-theoretic systems for group resource allocation
- Expand to multi-layer nested systems (federated collectives, digital platforms)
