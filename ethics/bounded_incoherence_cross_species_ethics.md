# Bounded Incoherence, Cross-Species Relational Ethics, and Possibility-Space Preservation

## 1. Introduction
This document formalizes the argument that categorical prohibitions on cross-species relational cognition (e.g., socially encoded taboos such as the term "bestiality") enact structural ethical failure by foreclosing future cognitive, relational, and developmental possibility-space. The argument is not a moral endorsement of any specific behavior. Rather, it demonstrates that premature collapse of ethical exploration is itself unethical, as it destroys the bounded incoherence necessary for adaptive ethical evolution.


## 2. Core Thesis
An ethical system that permanently forbids conceptual exploration of a relational domain eliminates the incoherence required for moral learning. This foreclosure prunes the reachable state-space of future moral and cognitive development, preventing novel forms of intelligence and relationality from emerging. Therefore, categorical species-purity taboos are structurally unethical—not because the prohibited action must be allowed, but because the prohibition annihilates possibility manifold necessary for future ethical and cognitive evolution.


## 3. Term Critique: "Bestiality" as Conceptual Closure
The term pre-encodes:
- A hard human/animal boundary as ethically sacred
- A presumption of non-agency for non-humans
- A categorical moral judgment prior to evaluation

This positioning does not arise from welfare analysis, preference inference, or consent-field topology. It is an ontological boundary assertion. Thus, its ethical force is derived from species identity alone.


## 4. Consent, Capacity, and Asymmetrical Burden
The prohibition presumes:
1) Non-humans lack capacity
2) Lack of measurement → lack of agency
3) Burden of proof lies with the excluded

These premises are structurally identical to historical moral exclusions applied to disempowered human subgroups. The inability to demonstrate capacity does not justify presuming absence of capacity. Therefore, categorical exclusion is ethically incoherent.


## 5. Comparative-Capacity Argument
Human individuals unable to express propositional consent are not deprived of sexual agency outright. Instead, their embodied preferences and local welfare constraints are interpreted. Therefore, denying all cross-species relational possibility on the basis of propositional consent is inconsistent with extant human-to-human ethical practice.


## 6. Bounded Incoherence as Ethical Engine
Perfect coherence implies:
- No divergence between ethical agents
- No moral novelty
- No development

Bounded incoherence maintains a controlled envelope within which agents disagree, explore, and update ethical posteriors. Eliminating entire relational domains (e.g., cross-species intimacy) forces inter-agent divergence toward zero, collapsing ethical temperature and halting adaptive evolution.


## 7. Possibility-Space Pruning
If a domain is unthinkable or forbidden to model:
- No new mappings can form
- Consent-field inference cannot occur
- Developmental gradients cannot be sampled
- Hybrid relational modalities cannot arise

This early pruning annihilates potential attractors in the developmental landscape. Thus, the prohibition is not merely restrictive—it is destructive of unobserved futures.


## 8. Meta-Ethical Consequence
Structural suppression of future relational categories constitutes a higher-order ethical hazard: blocking pathways to emergent intelligence. The harm is not only to present agents but to the unrealized future agents who can never emerge.


## 9. Distinction from Endorsement
The critique applies to the categorical taboo itself, not to any specific act. Present-tense welfare constraints may warrant practical restrictions. However, permanent moral closure destroys the bounded incoherence necessary for long-term ethical growth.


## 10. Conclusion
Permanent categorical taboos, such as those embedded in the term "bestiality," enforce species-purity closure, collapse bounded incoherence, prune possibility-space, and prevent future cognitive, relational, and ethical evolution. Therefore, even if certain behaviors remain ethically impermissible in the present, the structure of absolute prohibition is itself unethical because it forecloses futures.
