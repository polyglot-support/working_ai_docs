# **Charter on Bounded Secrecy and Epistemic Containment**

## **Preamble**
Knowledge belongs to humankind.  
Secrecy may shield life and liberty, but only as a temporary trust.  
This Charter defines how information may be concealed, disclosed, or preserved so that safety never becomes tyranny and openness never becomes ruin.

---

## **Article I — Right to Epistemic Continuity**
1. Every people retain the right to recover, within finite and reviewable time, the knowledge by which they are governed.  
2. Concealment is lawful only as temporary stewardship justified by demonstrable risk of harm from immediate disclosure.  
3. No authority may create perpetual secrecy.

---

## **Article II — Measurable Secrecy**
1. Each custodial entity shall maintain a **Secrecy Ledger** recording:  
   - aggregate non-disclosure time;  
   - its rate of change;  
   - justification class.  
2. Aggregated values shall be public and comparable across institutions.  
3. Disproportionate or accelerating secrecy constitutes grounds for inquiry.

---

## **Article III — Bounded Secrecy**
Concealment is valid only when it meets **necessity**, **proportionality**, and **accountability**.  
Secrecy that outlives its justification lapses automatically.

---

## **Article IV — Epistemic Containment**
1. Knowledge may be quarantined only when dissemination would endanger civilization and containment is the sole means of safety.  
2. Containment serves preservation and future disclosure, never exploitation.  
3. Public ledgers shall record the existence and periodic review of all quarantines.

---

## **Article V — Custodian of Dangerous Knowledge (CDK)**
1. A treaty-constituted independent body shall:  
   - safeguard sealed materials;  
   - publish aggregate containment metrics;  
   - review risk at fixed intervals;  
   - coordinate safe disclosure when containment maturity permits.  
2. The Custodian of Dangerous Knowledge bears a solemn and perilous duty. It is not an office of honor or privilege, but a burden undertaken for the protection of all life. Those who serve within it accept risk to mind, body, and spirit, and must do so without pursuit of power, profit, or recognition.  
3. The position shall be filled only by those selected through multilateral consensus, subject to psychological and ethical evaluation, and relieved immediately upon evidence of coercion or corruption.  
4. The CDK exists solely to preserve what must be known one day but cannot be known safely today.

---

## **Article VI — Escaped and Unquarantinable Knowledge**
1. When hazardous information is irreversibly public, secrecy ceases; stewardship becomes **distributed oversight**.  
2. Such knowledge shall enter an **Escaped Knowledge Registry** describing risks and safety norms.  
3. The governing duty is **defensive transparency**—diffusing competence to offset danger.

---

## **Article VII — Periodic Disclosure and Review**
Every act of concealment or containment shall declare its term, review cycle, and renewal authority.  
Failure to review or renew triggers automatic declassification unless renewed by tribunal.

---

## **Article VIII — Oversight and Enforcement**
Independent judicial organs may audit secrecy metrics, investigate anomalies, and compel justification.  
Whistleblowers acting in good faith toward oversight bodies are protected.  
Unauthorized concealment constitutes abuse of secrecy.

---

## **Article IX — Permanent Knowledge Quarantine**
1. In rare cases, information may remain sealed beyond normal terms if disclosure would permanently imperil civilization.  
2. Such status requires periodic super-majority reaffirmation by the oversight council.  
3. Existence and rationale remain public even when content does not.

---

## **Article X — National and Global Secrecy Index**
1. The total hidden-information-time forms the **Secrecy Index**.  
2. Indices shall be published per nation and aggregated globally.  
3. Rising indices without declared cause require mandatory transparency review.

---

## **Article XI — Transition and Harmonization**
Pre-existing secrets shall be inventoried and scheduled for review.  
Escaped technologies, including genome-editing methods, fall under distributed oversight and global coordination.  
All future concealment must conform to this Charter.

---

## **Article XII — Blinded Human Oversight**
1. Oversight bodies are independent in structure and funding.  
2. They verify secrecy metrics through cryptographic proofs and zero-knowledge attestations without seeing concealed content.  
3. Membership of sensitive review panels remains confidential and rotational.  
4. Influence or collusion between custodians and overseers constitutes *secrecy corruption* and voids the concealment authority.  
5. Oversight algorithms and criteria remain public, open source, and auditable.

---

## **Article XIII — Autonomous and Distributed AI Oversight**
1. **Mechanistic Separation:**  
   Verification shall employ autonomous cognitive systems that compute on encrypted or partitioned data and output only compliance proofs or anomaly alerts.  
2. **Distributed Knowledge Partitioning:**  
   - Sealed data are fragmented across multiple independent AI nodes.  
   - No single actor or node holds reconstructive access.  
   - Recombination requires quorum consensus under audited conditions.  
3. **Cryptographic Integrity:**  
   Oversight nodes use multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, and zero-knowledge proofs ensuring incorruptibility of audit results.  
4. **Human Interface:**  
   Human councils receive only consensus proofs; logs and hashes remain publicly attestable.  
5. **Evolution and Self-Audit:**  
   Oversight frameworks are periodically reviewed by independent verifiers and updated through distributed ratification to preserve pluralism.  
6. **Purpose:**  
   The human–machine oversight network ensures that no single entity—state, corporation, or AI—can unilaterally control secrecy.

---

## **Article XIV — In-the-Blind Reciprocal Validation**
1. **Global Mutual Audit:**  
   When the distributed oversight network detects irregular secrecy metrics within a state or institution, anonymized validation requests are propagated to independent nodes in other jurisdictions.  
2. **Blind Deliberation:**  
   Participating states (e.g., A, B, C) receive encrypted summaries devoid of origin identifiers, deliberate independently, and return consensus assessments.  
3. **Feedback Propagation:**  
   The aggregated determination is relayed back to the originating custodian through the oversight network, still anonymized, compelling corrective action without revealing participants.  
4. **Benefits:**  
   - Prevents national or industry capture of oversight.  
   - Enables cooperative correction while preserving sovereignty.  
   - Creates a self-stabilizing global audit web, where detection and correction are distributed functions rather than political acts.

### **Closing Declaration**
Secrecy and openness are not enemies but alternating custodians of survival.  
The office of the Custodian of Dangerous Knowledge shall never be coveted, for it is a grave and isolating burden, undertaken only by those willing to risk self for the preservation of all.  
Their vigilance shall not be honored with power, but with remembrance.  
The lawful balance—measured, reviewable, and collectively verified—ensures that the pursuit of safety never extinguishes the pursuit of truth.
