# Opposed Mathematics — Vol. G: Proofs, Meta‑theory, Conservativity (v1)

> Purpose. Provide core proofs: (G1) Church–Rosser/confluence for `⊕` under OM axioms, (G2) conservativity of the forgetful functor to classical mathematics, (G3) primewise legality for `div_n` and CRT compatibility, (G4) non‑signaling across k‑level cascades. Each statement includes a precise formulation, proof/outline, and projection notes.

## G0. Preliminaries
- From Vol. A: `𝔈` (exclusory class), involution `overline{·}`, cancellation sum `⊕`, nil `𝓝`, normal form operator `red_⊕`.
- From Vol. B: finite abelian groups `G`, multiplication maps `μ_n`, legal sublayers `G^{⟨n⟩} = nG`, CRT decompositions.
- From Vol. C: path amplitudes/states, marginals, cascade operators (legal divisions, symmetry quotients, character shifts).
- From Vol. D: †‑SMC/SCFA presentation (spider calculus).
- Notation: equality modulo associativity/commutativity of `⊕` is written `=_{AC}`.

## G1. Confluence Theorem (Church–Rosser for `⊕`)

### G1.1 Statement
Let `R` be the rewrite system on `𝔈` generated by the single oriented rule
```
(A ⊕ overline(A))  →  𝓝
```
for any `A ⊆ U`, with context closure and modulo AC of `⊕`. Then `R` is **terminating** and **confluent modulo AC**. Consequently, for every `X ∈ 𝔈`, the normal form `red_⊕(X)` exists and is unique up to AC.

### G1.2 Termination
Define a well‑founded measure `m : 𝔈 → ℕ × ℕ` by
```
m(X) := (pairs(X), size(X))
```
lexicographically, where `pairs(X)` counts the number of disjoint opposed pairs that can occur in `X`, and `size(X)` counts total atom occurrences. Any application of the rule strictly decreases `pairs(X)`; when equal, it decreases `size(X)` because two summands are replaced by `𝓝`. Hence no infinite reduction sequence exists.

### G1.3 Local Confluence (Critical Pairs)
Modulo AC, overlaps have only the following forms:
1) **Disjoint:** two redexes in disjoint subterms commute.
2) **Nested:** `( (A ⊕ overline(A)) ⊕ Y )` vs. reduction inside `Y`; reducing the inner redex yields `𝓝 ⊕ Y` on one branch and `𝓝 ⊕ red_⊕(Y)` on the other—joinable by termination.
3) **Shared atom:** `(A ⊕ overline(A)) ⊕ (A ⊕ overline(A))` reduces either pair first; both reach `𝓝 ⊕ 𝓝 =_{AC} 𝓝` by neutrality.
Thus `R` is locally confluent modulo AC.

### G1.4 Confluence
By Newman’s Lemma (termination + local confluence ⇒ confluence), `R` is confluent modulo AC. Hence `red_⊕` is well‑defined and unique (Vol. A Theorem A3.1).

### G1.5 Projection Note
Under the nil‑collapse projection `𝓝 ↦ 0`, confluence specializes to standard cancellation in abelian groups (equal and opposite contributions sum to 0).

## G2. Conservativity of the Forgetful Functor

### G2.1 Setting
Let `OM` be the category of OM‑structures `(𝔈, ⊕, overline{·}, 𝓝; Ξ; …)` and `Class` the category of classical structures (sets, abelian groups, etc.). Define the **forgetful/semantics functor**
```
Forget := (Ξ → 1) ∘ (𝓝 ↦ 0) : OM → Class
```
which erases character data and collapses `𝓝` to the classical zero/empty element as appropriate.

### G2.2 Statement (Conservativity)
For any OM‑diagram/equality `D₁ = D₂` expressible purely in the language of classical structures after applying `Forget`,
```
If  Forget(D₁) = Forget(D₂)  holds in Class,
then D₁ = D₂  holds in OM when both sides use only classical operations.
```
Equivalently: `Forget` **reflects** equality on the classical fragment; OM is a conservative extension over classical mathematics.

### G2.3 Proof Sketch
- Interpret the classical fragment of OM in models where `⊕` coincides with classical addition and `overline{·}` with additive inverse (after `Ξ→1`, `𝓝→0`).
- Build a **retraction/section pair** between the classical fragment and its image under `Forget`: the inclusion functor `Incl : Class → OM` (as trivial characters and `𝓝=0`) satisfies `Forget ∘ Incl = id_Class`.
- If `Forget(D₁)=Forget(D₂)`, applying `Incl` yields the same equality in OM with trivial characters and `𝓝=0`; since `⊕` reduces to classical addition there, the equality is identically the classical one. Therefore, any classical equality valid after projection is valid in OM’s classical fragment.

### G2.4 Corollaries
- No classical theorem is contradicted by OM; classical results embed faithfully.
- Extra equalities in OM require use of nontrivial characters or `⊕`‑reduction beyond additive inverses; these disappear under `Forget`.

## G3. Primewise Legality & CRT Compatibility

### G3.1 Statement (Primewise Legality)
Let `G` be finite abelian with `G ≅ ⊕_p G_{(p)}`. For integer `n`:
```
μ_n : G → G  is bijective  ⇔  μ_n|_{G_{(p)}} is bijective for every p  ⇔  gcd(n, |G|)=1.
```
Moreover, for non‑coprime `n`, the image satisfies
```
Im(μ_n) = ⊕_p Im( μ_n|_{G_{(p)}} ) = nG,
```
and any right‑inverse (section) on `nG` decomposes as a product of sections on the primary components.

### G3.2 Proof
- By the structure theorem, `G_{(p)} ≅ ⊕_i Z_{p^{k_i}}`. On `Z_{p^{k}}`, `μ_n` is bijective iff `p ∤ n`, since multiplication by `n` is invertible mod `p^{k}` iff `n` is a unit in `ℤ/p^{k}ℤ`.
- Bijectivity on all primary components implies bijectivity on the sum. Conversely, a global bijection restricts to bijections.
- The image identity follows by direct sum functoriality. Sections can be chosen componentwise and tensored by CRT isomorphisms.

### G3.3 Compatibility with CRT Coordinates
Under the natural CRT isomorphism `Z_m ≅ ⊕_p Z_{p^{k_p}}`, the operator `div_n` corresponds to applying `div_{n mod p^{k_p}}` on each component where legal and restricting to the legal sublayer otherwise. Centroid invariance (Vol. B) is preserved componentwise and hence globally.

## G4. Non‑signaling Lemma (k‑Level Cascades)

### G4.1 Framework
Let `X = A × B` and let `ψ : X^k → ℕ_{≥0}[Ξ] ∪ {𝓝}` be a k‑ary state (Vol. C). Consider **local cascades** on `A` generated by:
1) Legal divisions `div_n` applied to `A`‑coordinates only,
2) Character shifts on `A` only,
3) Symmetry quotients that identify only `A`‑coordinates (no dependence on `B`).
Denote any composition of such steps by `R_A` and its lifting to `X^k` by `R_A ⊗ id_B`.

### G4.2 Statement (Non‑signaling)
For all k‑ary states `ψ` and all such `R_A`:
```
Marg_B( red_⊕( (R_A ⊗ id_B)(ψ) ) ) = Marg_B( red_⊕( ψ ) ).
```
That is, `B`‑marginals are invariant under arbitrary `A`‑local cascades.

### G4.3 Proof
It suffices to check each generator and use closure under composition.
- **(i) Character shifts on A)** multiply amplitudes by unit‑modulus phases dependent only on `A`; summing over `A` in the marginal erases them. `⊕`‑reduction is fiberwise in `A`, hence commutes with summation over `A`.
- **(ii) Legal divisions on A)** `div_n` permutes (or partially sections within) the `A` fiber without touching `B`; marginalization over `A` is invariant under permutations and section/reindexing. Cancellations occur within each `A` fiber; totals over `A` are unchanged.
- **(iii) Symmetry quotients on A)** quotienting `A` groups fibers into cosets; within each coset, opposed contributions cancel by `⊕`. The sum over all elements of the coset equals the sum over the class‑representative in the quotient; therefore the total over `A` is identical before and after the quotient.
By linearity and associativity/commutativity of `⊕`, any composition of these preserves the `B` marginal. QED.

### G4.4 Projection Note
After embedding to Hilbert space (Vol. E), this lemma instantiates standard non‑signaling: local unitaries and projective measurements on `A` do not change reduced density operators on `B`.
