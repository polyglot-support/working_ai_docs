# Objective Science Is Only a Subset of Science

Modern "objective" science is often treated as the sole legitimate path to knowledge. Historically, this is backwards. Most sciences began as conceptual explorations—people reasoning about unseen structure long before instruments existed. The early phases of science blend philosophy, speculation, and structured observation. These do not threaten science; they are how science starts.

Below, we explore how pre-instrumental reasoning laid the foundations for every major scientific field.

## 1) Historical sciences begin before measurement
Almost every mature science began pre-empirical:

- Atomism preceded chemistry
- Natural philosophy preceded physics
- Heredity theories preceded genetics
- Continental drift preceded plate tectonics

Early phases were qualitative, speculative, inference-driven—not objective in the modern sense.

> Objective, instrument-driven science is the late stage of a process, not the definition of it.

## 2) Empirical method depends on prior conceptual invention
Before we can measure X, someone must:
- define X
- argue it matters
- propose mechanisms

These steps are conceptual and often subjective.

You need the concept of "gene" before discovering DNA.
You need the concept of "force" before measuring acceleration.

> Science requires non-empirical scaffolding to exist.

## 3) Subjective observation is still observation
A phenomenon may be:
- publicly measurable
- introspected
- modeled
- simulated

All can be scientifically relevant.

If consciousness exists only as private experience, subjective reports remain data.

> "Subjective" means not yet externally operationalized, not unscientific.

## 4) Philosophy is protoscience
When measurement is impossible, philosophy:
- identifies the domain
- defines vocabulary
- proposes structure
- tests logical consistency

This is how we got:
- atomism
- heliocentrism
- evolution
- conservation laws

Science fiction does similar work, proposing concepts before instruments exist.

> Philosophical and fictional reasoning is a pre-instrumental scientific stage.

## 5) Restricting science prevents new sciences
If only measurable domains "count," new fields cannot emerge.

This would have killed:
- electromagnetism before Faraday
- relativity before precise clocks
- quantum theory before spectroscopy

> Denying non-objective inquiry freezes science.

## 6) Simulated physics as a generator of new sciences
If physics can be simulated from first principles, video‑game‑style rule systems enable:

- new force laws
- alternative dimensionality
- modified topology
- engineered causal structure
- synthetic thermodynamics
- new matter classes
- evolutionary systems with different priors
- meta‑laws and rule‑space analysis

Results include:
- experimental metaphysics
- synthetic universes
- computational cosmology
- computational ontology

> Novel sciences emerge via conceptual and simulated experimentation before physical instrumentation exists.

# Final Synthesis

We typically imagine science as a modern, instrument-driven process. But this view only captures its final stage. Scientific inquiry begins with questions and models—long before devices exist to measure anything. Philosophy and imagination identify the domain; only later does instrumentation mature and formalize it.

Seen this way, subjective, philosophical, and synthetic approaches are not alternatives to science. They are its earliest phases. Every modern field began as an attempt to reason systematically about structure that could not yet be measured.

Objective measurement is a refinement—not an origin.

Therefore, three modes of inquiry must be valued as continuous parts of science:

- **Subjective science** — introspection, experience, careful reflection
- **Philosophical science** — concept formation, logical exploration
- **Synthetic science** — simulated or constructed realities used to probe rule-space

Science is simply: **systematic inquiry into the structure of reality.**

Its earliest forms ask, imagine, and model. Its later forms measure.

Both are science.
