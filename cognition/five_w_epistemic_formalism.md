# Formalism of the 5W Dimensions in the Extended Epistemic Model

## 1. Overview
This document formalizes the recognition process of **How, When, Where, What, and Why** (5W) within the extended epistemic topology comprising the five knowledge types \( \{ KF, KA, KX, KY, KXY \} \). Each dimension corresponds to a measurable operation or relation in the epistemic manifold, linking information dynamics, temporal balance, and reflective recursion.

## 2. Dimensional Roles

| Dimension | Function in the Lattice | Operator / Manifold Component | Primary Temporal Domain | Knowledge Type Correlation |
|------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **How** | Mechanism of epistemic transition | Transition operator \( \mathcal{T}_{ij} \) (causal mapping) | Process-time \( \sigma \) | KA, KXY |
| **When** | Temporal equilibrium moment enabling integration | Temporal balance condition \( \Phi_+ = \Phi_- \) | Causal–retrocausal Now-surface | KX, KXY |
| **Where** | Spatial or scale localization within epistemic lattice | Scale coordinate \( \lambda \), reducibility matrix | Scale-space manifold | KF, KA |
| **What** | Content of informational invariants | Reflective fixed points \( h_t(K) = K \) | Static equilibrium | KX |
| **Why** | Motivational / ethical closure maintaining coherence | Entropic-gradient minimization \( \partial S / \partial t = 0 \) with ethical constraints | Macro-cyclic control \( \theta \) | KF, KXY |

## 3. Formal Operator System

### 3.1 How: Procedural Causation
\[
\text{How:}\quad \mathcal{T}_{ij}(K_i) = f_{ij}(K_i, \lambda, \sigma)
\]
Defines the *active transformation rule* governing informational reconfiguration (e.g., inquiry, elicitation).  
- **Condition:** \( \mathcal{T}_{ij} \) conserves epistemic potential \( N(K_i) = N(K_j) \).  
- **Cognitive Mode:** procedural reasoning, experimentation.

### 3.2 When: Temporal Equilibrium Gate
\[
\text{When:}\quad \Phi_+(\lambda, t) = \Phi_-(\lambda, t)
\]
Defines the **moment of reflective admission**, the equilibrium between forward and backward informational fluxes.  
- **Interpretation:** the *instant of learning recognition*; bitemporal symmetry condition.
- **Cognitive Mode:** insight, realization.

### 3.3 Where: Scale Localization
\[
\text{Where:}\quad \nabla_\lambda K(\lambda, t) = 0
\]
Identifies the scale \( \lambda \) or region within the lattice where informational gradients stabilize.  
- **Interpretation:** the *domain of effective learning*; location of epistemic reconfiguration.
- **Cognitive Mode:** contextual mapping, situational awareness.

### 3.4 What: Informational Invariant
\[
\text{What:}\quad h_t(K) = K
\]
Specifies self-consistency under recursive reflection \( h_t \).  
- **Interpretation:** the *stable informational remainder* after bidirectional filtering (the learnable content).  
- **Cognitive Mode:** comprehension, definition, articulation.

### 3.5 Why: Ethical–Entropic Closure
\[
\text{Why:}\quad \frac{\partial S_{\text{ep}}}{\partial t} + \Omega_{\text{eth}} = 0
\]
Combines epistemic entropy flow and ethical stabilizer \( \Omega_{\text{eth}} \) to ensure non-destructive learning.  
- **Interpretation:** the *reason for stabilization*; conserving the integrity of the epistemic system.  
- **Cognitive Mode:** justification, moral reasoning, integration.

## 4. Interactions Across Knowledge Types

| Knowledge Type | How | When | Where | What | Why |
|----------------|-----|------|-------|------|------|
| **KF** | Consolidation through reduction | Persistent equilibrium | Deep scale core | Foundational invariant | Ethical stability (culpability closure) |
| **KA** | Generation of transitions | Dynamic exploration | Peripheral exploratory scale | Procedural constructs | Curiosity-driven entropy gradient |
| **KX** | Stabilization via reflection | Instant equilibrium | Transitional boundary | Learned fixed point | Reflective satisfaction |
| **KY** | Perturbation and divergence | Continuous flux | Fluid, high-scale | Emergent potential | Adaptive motivation |
| **KXY** | Mediation of dual fluxes | Phase-tuned equilibrium | Interface manifold | Dual invariant pair \( (\kappa_d, \kappa_p) \) | Balancing ethic: exploration vs. grounding |

## 5. Composite Formalism

The five dimensions function as orthogonal axes of epistemic recognition:
\[
R(K) = (\mathcal{T}, \Phi, \lambda, h_t, S_{\text{ep}})
\]
Each learning event can thus be represented as a tuple:
\[
\mathbb{L} = (How_i, When_i, Where_i, What_i, Why_i)
\]
with mapping:
\[
\mathbb{L} : K_{n} \mapsto K_{n+1} = f(\mathcal{T}, \Phi, \lambda, h_t, S_{\text{ep}})
\]
This tuple defines the *epistemic recognition operator* —the structured act of learning as perceived from within the manifold.

## 6. Phenomenological Summary

- **How**: The procedural mechanism through which new information interacts.  
- **When**: The temporal signature of insight (equilibrium).  
- **Where**: The contextual scale of learning.  
- **What**: The invariant informational outcome.  
- **Why**: The integrative and ethical purpose sustaining coherence.

Together they form the **reflective 5-vector of cognition**, mapping the trajectory of information from uncertain exchange to stable knowledge within the extended epistemic manifold.
